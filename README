## RNA structure analysis:

Script for identification of RNA structure that in mRNA transcripts

mRNA consists of three specific regions 5'UTR CDS 3'UTR

we created custom number of bins where 5'UTR is represented as 20 bins, CDS is represented as 100 bin, 3'UTR is represented as 70 bins


## Usage:
python structural_data_custom_bins.py -genes genes -structure structure_data.bed -utr5 _5utr.bed -cds _cds.bed -utr3 _3utr.bed -output output
